# Hello, world! 👋

![status](https://api.statusbadges.me/badge/status/662912619975278592?simple=true&style=flat-square)

Welcome to my profile! This is one of the few places you can find me on the internet.

Most of my open-source projects will probably be [here](https://github.com/oAnblu?tab=repositories/), but some might be in their own organizations.

# 🪣 Stack

I mostly use [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), but sometimes I also use [Deno](https://deno.com/).

# 📫 Contact

If you want to contact me, you can send me a message on discord: [@oAnblu](https://discordapp.com/users/662912619975278592), or you can email me: [oAnblu@outlook.com](mailto:oAnblu@outlook.com)

also if you are a nerd, [here's my public key](https://github.com/oAnblu.gpg).
