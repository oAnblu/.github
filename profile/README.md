Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is one of the few places you can find me on the internet. Most of my open-source projects will probably be [here](https://github.com/oAnblu?tab=repositories/), but some might be in their own organizations. I mostly use [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) on [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), but sometimes I also use [Deno](https://deno.com/).

If you want to contact me, you can send me a message on discord: [@oAnblu](https://discordapp.com/users/662912619975278592), or you can email me: [oAnblu@outlook.com](mailto:oAnblu@outlook.com).

as of writing, my main project is [Nexel](https://github.com/oAnblu/Nexel).

also if you are a nerd, [here's my public key](https://github.com/oAnblu.gpg).
